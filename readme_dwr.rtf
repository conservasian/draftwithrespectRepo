To do:\
- use defensive depth chart for defensive players\
- display defensive players with incident first\
\'97 better yet, present them in a defensive lineup format\
\
- table should sort by alphabetical and by # incidents (tablesorter plugin)\
\
- search by team?\
\
- add link to Google search after list of sources\
- automatically pull NFL rosters once a month (or manual reminder\'85)\
\
- script that sorts players by current team (to see which first-line people are in the database) \
\
- email address using domain\
\
- include all active players with incidents in random placeholder\
\
